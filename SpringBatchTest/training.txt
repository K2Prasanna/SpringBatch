message channel can monitor the messages

pollable channels/subscribable channels/
no buffering for subscribes, event based notifications.

Point to point channels
direct channels(implements subscriber channel)/sync/blocks producers/point to point
QueueChannel (pollable channel)/aysnc/point to point/priority is FIFO
ExecutorChannel(subscriver chanel)/non-blocking/only deliver message/point to point
Priority channel (Queue channel with priority)
Rendezvous Channel/pollable chanel (blocking Queue channel with zero capacity)

Publish and subscribe (one producer and many consumers)
publish subscribe channel (parallel processing using task executors)

Temporary channels (not long leaving subscribale channel)

API gateway e.g., APIGEE, amazon API gateway: (uses temprorary channels)
services that provide services for business applications such as throttling, connectivity, scaling, monitoring, security
